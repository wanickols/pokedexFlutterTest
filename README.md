# pokedexFlutterTest
## To Download
This is a flutter project that can be downloaded and run in android studio or Xcode. It will require the flutter extensions and/or the flutter app. 

## Purpose
This is a test project to test out the abilities of FlutterFlow as well as to familiarize myself with dart and flutter. I have a project I will be working on developing an app for both android and ios for phones and tablets, and this tool is a potential solution.

## Benefits
While I have experience in mobile design with android studio, I hope to get a much more robust understanding of mobile development as well as learn dart and flutter for future use.

## Status
So far, I have explored flutter flow quite comprehensively and done a little dart. I have a working project capable of API calls and basic widgets.
